# Education-Inequality 
For this project, we are utilizing two distinct data sets. The primary data set is sourced from EdGap.org, called the EdGap data set, which contains valuable information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools, along with several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district. This data set is from 2016. In addition, we are also using a secondary data set that provides basic information about each school, obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics.
