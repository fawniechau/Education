# Education-Inequality 
For this project, we are utilizing two distinct data sets. The primary data set is sourced from EdGap.org, called the EdGap data set, which contains valuable information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools, along with several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district. This data set is from 2016. In addition, we are also using a secondary data set that provides basic information about each school, obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics.
## Sources for the Data
School information data: https://www.dropbox.com/s/lkl5nvcdmwyoban/ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv?dl=0

Edgap data: https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.892/-96.987

Education Commission of the States: It provides reports that compare educational policies across 50 states. We found 2 different reports about non-course requirements for high school graduation from 2019 and the school year 2017-2018. Even though we are working with 2016-2017 data, the 2017-2018 is a good start to learn about the states that have SAT/ACT requirements as graduation:

EdWeek.org: provides a table with the 2016-2017 data of the states that require SAT/ACT  and other exams. However, it is not as detailed as the reports from the Education Commission of the States.
